# 29-2-shape-interface

You have a set of classes of various geometric shapes: a circle (Circle), a rectangle (Rectangle) and a triangle (Triangle), which are inherited from the general class geometric figure (Shape).
Each of these classes has methods for calculating the area, describing the rectangle, and taking the type.
There is also a general function printParams which, according to the pointer to an object of type geometric figure passed to it, displays the type of figure.
